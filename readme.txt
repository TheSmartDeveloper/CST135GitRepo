The background for this project is that we need to create a vending machine that can input items and dispense them for the user. In implementing this program I decided to create abstract classes of product, drinks, and snacks so that each individual item object could inherit the properties from these super classes. Doing this allowed similar properties to be shared between all the classes and the unique ones can be held by each item.

As of right now, the user does not need to do anything special to run the program.
